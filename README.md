# MaxSquadsAdjustment
Sets max squad size to 14 and reworks Master of Maneuver

Starting squad number for armies is 4 instead of default 3.

Master of Maneuver is changed from 1 bonus squad to 3 for the first 3 tiers.
MoM 1 : 1 -> 3
MoM 2 : 1 -> 3
MoM 3 : 1 -> 3
MoM 4 : 1 :( 1

Thought about changing it to be something like 1, 2, 3, then 4 so that there'd be a progression as you get the higher ranks, but really after the first 1 or 2 you don't have enough units to easily fill out the last couple slots and MoM 4 is somewhat rare as it comes from either an Act 5 event or the fallout quest. So instead you get to 13 squad size with leveling a general, and the 14th is a little more involved.

Also, running lots of units without knowing about things like the aggro system or the risk of getting hit by an AoE really just means that the extra squad size can be a trap anyways, and I amuse myself at the thought of someone running into a Balor for the first time and getting half their army nuked by firestorm.
