# MaxSquadsAdjustment
Sets max squad size to 14 and reworks Master of Maneuver

Unforunately the setting in toybox only increases the max squad size to 14 for armies, but it doesn't increase the max squads that can be fielded in tactical combats. This mod increases the latter to 14, and adjusts base size and MoM to reach 14 on the world map.

Starting squad number for armies is 4 instead of default 3.

Master of Maneuver is changed from 1 bonus squad to 3 for the first 3 tiers.
MoM 1 : 1 -> 3
MoM 2 : 1 -> 3
MoM 3 : 1 -> 3
MoM 4 : 1 :( 1

Thought about changing it to be something like 1, 2, 3, then 4 so that there'd be a progression as you get the higher ranks, but really after the first 1 or 2 you don't have enough units to easily fill out the last couple slots and MoM 4 is somewhat rare as it comes from either an Act 5 event or the fallout quest. So instead you get to 13 squad size with leveling a general, and the 14th is a little more involved.

Also, running lots of units without knowing about things like the aggro system or the risk of getting hit by an AoE really just means that the extra squad size can be a trap anyways, and I amuse myself at the thought of someone running into a Balor for the first time and getting half their army nuked by firestorm.
